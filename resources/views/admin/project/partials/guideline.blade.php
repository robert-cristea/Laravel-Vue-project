            <li>Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia (LLM) is the highways agency served under government and is committed to contributing the Government's target for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions.</li>
            <li>The first project was originally initiated on 2012, whereby during the time the introduction of Malaysia Green Highway Index (MyGHI) was introduced which concerning in depth on the scope of points for sustainable practices and policies.</li>
            <li>The five main criteria cover mainly in sustainable design and construction; energy efficiency; environmental and water management; material and technology; and social and safety.</li>
            <li>After several discussions with LLM, Concessionaire and UTM, LLM would like to extend their study to a holistic assessment of the impact of Malaysian Highway on the environment, ranging from site clearing, supply activities, administration and interaction with its stakeholders and also during its operation.</li>
            <li>Align with The National Green Technology Policy greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission was introduced in order to ensure sustainable development approach can significantly progress besides providing the major improvement, especially in the transportation sector. Carbon footprint is commonly used to describe the total amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for which an individual and an organisation is responsible. Besides that it can be defined as total amount of CO2 and GHGs (direct and indirect) emitted over the full cycle of a road. The life cycle includes construction, operation, and maintenance phases. Its “life” ends when the road needs to be completely reconstructed or when it is abandoned.</li>

            Why we need Carbon Footprint Calculator?
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-9 guideline-pill-white">
        This Carbon Calculator Tool was developed to enable the Highway Concessionaire to identify their carbon footprint associate with four phases of Highway’s life cycle namely Design, Construction, Operation and Maintenance stage. The tool provides a baseline reporting from the reported period calculation of carbon and GHG emissions as part of a Carbon Reduction Initiative. The users need to provide the required input data for each work-book sheet in order to calculate GHG emissions from different aspects such as electrical, water, transportation, waste product / material, papers used, and plantation of trees. Inside the calculator sheet, Design & Construction stages are combined in one folder together and same goes to Operation & Maintenance stages. By using this calculator, the user can see the result of both direct and indirect emissions and GHG produced.

            Concessionaire have to keep recording of their historical data  on energy, water consumption, paper, materials on site usage/ transportation, fuel consumption, tree plantation and waste monthly and annuallly. The data need to be provide in 3 stages of highway namely design stage, construction stage and operation/maintenance stage. For design stage, design consultant need to provide data consumption on electrical, water, paper and transportation for office usage only during the highway design period. In construction stage, highway concessionaire need to provide activity data which emitted CO2 during construction stage. The activity divides into 3 scopes:
            <ul>
                <li>Scope 1: (Direct emission involves in machinery combustion onsite)</li>
                <li>Scope 2: (Indirect emission involves in electricity consumption and water consumption)</li>
                <li>Scope 3: (Embodied carbon involves in material usage, material transportation to construction site and paper used at site office)</li>
            </ul>
            Lastly in operation and maintenance stage, the data requirement involves in activity operate for highway maintenance such as electrical consumption, water consumption, transportation, waste material, paper and trees plantation.
